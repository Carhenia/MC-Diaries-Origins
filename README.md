This modpack is a re-release of the original Diaries modpack that was used on our servers. This re-release is specifically designed for old players to be able to load our old server files, which can be provided by requesting a copy from Carhenia. The modpack aims to replicate the setup used by Aphmau in her popular 2015 Minecraft series, Minecraft Diaries.

 The modpack is a fan-made creation and is not affiliated with Aphmau in any way. Nebula Network has no official association with Aphmau or her production team. The modpack is purely a labor of love and an attempt to recreate the early production of the Minecraft Diaries series for fans.

- This Modpack has been updated to newer versions of Minecraft! Visit the repository for [MC Diaries Revisited](https://github.com/Carhenia/MC-Diaries-Revisited) for more information. 
- We also offer a revised version of this modpack, which has been enhanced to improve functionality and provide a smoother, more refined experience. Visit the repository for [MC Diaries](https://github.com/Carhenia/MC-Diaries) for more information!

This repository is a collection of file modifications specifically created for the custom modpack. These modifications include changes to various configuration files such as .toml, .cfg, .txt, .json, and others. These files have been modified to ensure that the modpack functions correctly and provides the desired gameplay experience.

This modpack is maintained by Carhenia for [Nebula Network](https://nebulanetwork.net)
